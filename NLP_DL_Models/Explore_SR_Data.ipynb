       "      <td>I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.</td>\n",

       "2  I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.   \n",

When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.</td>\n",

We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. \\nI feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from XXXX to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years.

       "      <td>I am writing to request your assistance in looking into the deceptive practices of this collection law-firm above. It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. \\n\\n1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). \\n\\n2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. \\n\\n3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. \\n\\n4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. \\n\\n5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. \\n\\nThe company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. \\n\\nFacts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. \\n2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. \\n4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. \\n5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons. They filed a false affirmation with the clerk 's office.</td>\n",

       "2   I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "7   An account on my credit report has a mistaken date. I mailed in a debt validation letter to allow XXXX to correct the information. I received a letter in the mail, stating that Experian received my correspondence and found it to be \" suspicious '' and that \" I did n't write it ''. Experian 's letter is worded to imply that I am incapable of writing my own letter. I was deeply offended by this implication. \\nI called Experian to figure out why my letter was so suspicious. I spoke to a representative who was incredibly unhelpful, She did not effectively answer any questions I asked of her, and she kept ignoring what I was saying regarding the offensive letter and my dispute process. I feel the representative did what she wanted to do, and I am not satisfied. It is STILL not clear to me why I received this letter. I typed this letter, I signed this letter, and I paid to mail this letter, yet Experian willfully disregarded my lawful request. \\nI am disgusted with this entire situation, and I would like for my dispute to be handled appropriately, and I would like for an Experian representative to contact me and give me a real explanation for this letter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "25  Started the refinance of home mortgage process with cash out option on XX/XX/2016. Necessary documents were submitted by XXXX. After initial review, got good faith estimate with loan amount and closing cost. Based on this estimate, a deposit of {$350.00} was made towards appraisal. Appraisal came with lesser amount by {$5000.00}. Agreed to reduce the loan amount to that extent. However, got a revised estimate which was less by {$30000.00} and with additional closing cost towards points etc. In between got numerous revised estimates with different loan amounts and closing cost. It took more than 2 months to reach any definite closing document. Hence, want to get back the deposit of {$350.00}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "26  In XXXX, I and my ex-husband applied for a refinance & HELOC from Beneficial. The loans were granted. My ex-husband passed away XXXX XXXX. At this time I contacted a lawyer to determine my options for having my husband removed from the title to the property and mortgage. Lawyer took care of having husband removed from the title. I recently attempted to apply for refinance to remove him from the mortgage and take cash out. I learned through an attempt to refinance I was unable to refinance the property due to there is no deed from XXXX found indicating my interest in the property. The only deed filed with the XXXX County Illinois Recorder was in XXXX with the original purchase of the home in which my ex-husband was the only one listed on the deed. Beneficial did file a mortgage on XXXX, XXXX on the property. I am just outraged at this point that I took out a loan on my home, yet it was never deeded in my name as one of the rightful owners. Now I am being denied the ability to refinance at this time because I can not show that I was the rightful owner of this property prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when my children quit claimed their fathers interest to me. I am just sick of this company and the way this company misleads and XXXX over customers. I am technically being forced to remain with this company because I can not secure financing with another reputable company because I have to wait anywhere from 6 - 12months to refinance, because the property I have owned for over 20 years and paying on for over 20years is considered inheritance since it was just quit claimed to me XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "28  I have disputed several accounts on my credit report with Equifax several times. I first disputed with the original creditors, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX Solutions and after 3 letters did not receive any correspondence with proof. I sent copies of the letters and certified mail receipts to the credit bureau but they continue to verify these debts without copies of any proof with my signature. A statement of dispute was also never put on my credit report. Equifax only continues to update the accounts associated with these creditors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "29  Mortgage was transferred to Nationstar as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Since then our payments are not posted in a timely manner or for the amount sent. \\nfor example payment cleared our bank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for XXXX per the payment history received from Nationstar the payment was not posted until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and only for amount of XXXX. \\npayment cleared our bank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for XXXX but was not posted to our account until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and only for amount XXXX When our loan was transferred to Nationstar from XXXX we only received a good by letter from XXXX but no welcome package from Nationstar. So had to contact them to make sure the payment amount was the same as XXXX. I was told it was the same so that is what we are sending but they are only posting XXXX Have to call every month to get a payment history as they will not allow use of the website. Try to get information several times as to why it takes so long to post the money and why it is less than we sent. sent them the exact same documents attached and all they will state is they have no record of sending me the history every month and they are posting the money for what we sent. Have been unable to resolve the issue with Nationstar as they are not willing to listen or review the documents I sent to them as proof of what they sent me.

       "36  Was a happy XXXX card member for years, in late XX/XX/2016 XXXX converted the card portfolio to Barclaycard ( XXXX ). We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. \\nI feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from XXXX to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years. Completely unfair and is why the big financials have the hated reputation they have now.

       "49  I am writing to request your assistance in looking into the deceptive practices of this collection law-firm above. It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. \\n\\n1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). \\n\\n2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. \\n\\n3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. \\n\\n4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. \\n\\n5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. \\n\\nThe company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. \\n\\nFacts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. \\n2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. \\n4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. \\n5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons. They filed a false affirmation with the clerk 's office.   \n",

       "2      I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "7      An account on my credit report has a mistaken date. I mailed in a debt validation letter to allow XXXX to correct the information. I received a letter in the mail, stating that Experian received my correspondence and found it to be \" suspicious '' and that \" I did n't write it ''. Experian 's letter is worded to imply that I am incapable of writing my own letter. I was deeply offended by this implication. \\nI called Experian to figure out why my letter was so suspicious. I spoke to a representative who was incredibly unhelpful, She did not effectively answer any questions I asked of her, and she kept ignoring what I was saying regarding the offensive letter and my dispute process. I feel the representative did what she wanted to do, and I am not satisfied. It is STILL not clear to me why I received this letter. I typed this letter, I signed this letter, and I paid to mail this letter, yet Experian willfully disregarded my lawful request. \\nI am disgusted with this entire situation, and I would like for my dispute to be handled appropriately, and I would like for an Experian representative to contact me and give me a real explanation for this letter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "25     Started the refinance of home mortgage process with cash out option on XX/XX/2016. Necessary documents were submitted by XXXX. After initial review, got good faith estimate with loan amount and closing cost. Based on this estimate, a deposit of {$350.00} was made towards appraisal. Appraisal came with lesser amount by {$5000.00}. Agreed to reduce the loan amount to that extent. However, got a revised estimate which was less by {$30000.00} and with additional closing cost towards points etc. In between got numerous revised estimates with different loan amounts and closing cost. It took more than 2 months to reach any definite closing document. Hence, want to get back the deposit of {$350.00}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "26     In XXXX, I and my ex-husband applied for a refinance & HELOC from Beneficial. The loans were granted. My ex-husband passed away XXXX XXXX. At this time I contacted a lawyer to determine my options for having my husband removed from the title to the property and mortgage. Lawyer took care of having husband removed from the title. I recently attempted to apply for refinance to remove him from the mortgage and take cash out. I learned through an attempt to refinance I was unable to refinance the property due to there is no deed from XXXX found indicating my interest in the property. The only deed filed with the XXXX County Illinois Recorder was in XXXX with the original purchase of the home in which my ex-husband was the only one listed on the deed. Beneficial did file a mortgage on XXXX, XXXX on the property. I am just outraged at this point that I took out a loan on my home, yet it was never deeded in my name as one of the rightful owners. Now I am being denied the ability to refinance at this time because I can not show that I was the rightful owner of this property prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when my children quit claimed their fathers interest to me. I am just sick of this company and the way this company misleads and XXXX over customers. I am technically being forced to remain with this company because I can not secure financing with another reputable company because I have to wait anywhere from 6 - 12months to refinance, because the property I have owned for over 20 years and paying on for over 20years is considered inheritance since it was just quit claimed to me XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Equifax only continues to update the accounts associated with these creditors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "29     Mortgage was transferred to Nationstar as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Since then our payments are not posted in a timely manner or for the amount sent. \\nfor example payment cleared our bank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for XXXX per the payment history received from Nationstar the payment was not posted until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and only for amount of XXXX. \\npayment cleared our bank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for XXXX but was not posted to our account until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and only for amount XXXX When our loan was transferred to Nationstar from XXXX we only received a good by letter from XXXX but no welcome package from Nationstar. So had to contact them to make sure the payment amount was the same as XXXX. I was told it was the same so that is what we are sending but they are only posting XXXX Have to call every month to get a payment history as they will not allow use of the website. Try to get information several times as to why it takes so long to post the money and why it is less than we sent. sent them the exact same documents attached and all they will state is they have no record of sending me the history every month and they are posting the money for what we sent. Have been unable to resolve the issue with Nationstar as they are not willing to listen or review the documents I sent to them as proof of what they sent me. Have been calling them every month since XXXX XXXX to get a payment history but they deny sending it each month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "36     Was a happy XXXX card member for years, in late XX/XX/2016 XXXX converted the card portfolio to Barclaycard ( XXXX ). We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. \\nI feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from XXXX to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years. Completely unfair and is why the big financials have the hated reputation they have now. Hope you folks over there can investigate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

It was my understanding that under the FCRA I was entitled to a copy of this report, but was refused by Citi and have been given no further explanation. \\n\\nThis is predatory in that it affects my utilization of credit, further subjecting me to increase in APrs, etc and a higher cost of credit without any reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "49     I am writing to request your assistance in looking into the deceptive practices of this collection law-firm above. It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. \\n\\n1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). \\n\\n2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. \\n\\n3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. \\n\\n4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. \\n\\n5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. \\n\\nThe company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. \\n\\nFacts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. \\n2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. \\n4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. \\n5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons. They filed a false affirmation with the clerk 's office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "61     I am disputing the inaccurate information the Chex-Systems has on my credit report. I initially submitted a police report on XXXX/XXXX/16 and Chex Systems only deleted the items that I mentioned in the letter and not all the items that were actually listed on the police report. In other words they wanted me to say word for word to them what items were fraudulent. The total disregard of the police report and what accounts that it states that are fraudulent.

       "80     I attempted to open a XXXX XXXX account on XXXX XXXX 2017 and I was unable to due to misinformation on my credit report. They advised me to resolve the issue by disputing this information that is not mine and I am doing so. I also would like to say I had been a victim of consumer fraud and want to be issued protection from others being able to access my information for their own personal gain. I am in a position in which I can not even open an account because of this fradulent act against me and I need to recieve proper treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "85     I had an FHA loan at US Bank that was paid off on XXXX XXXX 2015. On paying the loan off on the XXXX XXXX instead of XXXX XXXX I was charged {$1000.00} interest fee. I spoke to US Bank in regards to this and was informed that they were unwilling to refund the charge of {$1000.00} even though the interest charged was the EXACT same day as the loan was paid off. I feel that a {$1000.00} charge for paying off a mortgage loan 2 days into the month is, for better words, a scam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "95     I went through a divorce several years ago and requested a home loan modification through Bank of America. Bank of America refused to get back to me on several occasions causing the process to take a year, destroying my credit in the process. Only when they got the foreclosure judgment and sent it to sheriff sale did they process it correctly and I paid on time for over a year. We decided to sell the home in 2015 and listed it for sale. After about 75 days, we received an offer and accepted. We promptly got an apartment, paid a deposit and signed a lease. We moved into the new apartment about 5 days before closing. As we were preparing for closing, it was discovered by the purchasing lender ( unknown to me ) that Bank of America had sold our overdue principal to HUD. This required us to sell our home for over {$150000.00} to break even. The house only appraised at around {$120000.00} because there have been so many foreclosures in our area. I contacted Bank of America to determine what we could do and informed them that we had a buyer if they could process the short sale immediately. They said that they would probably not be able to and \" hopefully the buyer was still around ''. They went through the same process of continually requesting updated information for months while the process dragged on. I lost my buyer and could make the mortgage payments AND the rent payment on my apartment so I continued to work through the home modification process. I contacted their lawyers several times, received a response on a few occassions. Finally, on XXXX XXXX, I received an email back from XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( Bank of America 's attorney ) saying that my loan has been \" service released '' to XXXX XXXX. I immediately called them to restart the process and was sent out a packet. I was in the process of submitting the packet and gathering all of the info they needed. My wife drove by the house and there was a sherrif sale notification on it for XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America, who would no longer work with me and would never respond and sold it to XXXX, processed a sheriff sale. They began the sheriff sale process AFTER I was informed by their lawyers that they no longer serviced the loan! I called XXXX and they confirmed that Bank of America did complete that. \\n\\nLastly, I logged on to the sheriff 's website to discover that BANK OF AMERICA bought it! \\n\\nI can only see this as they intentionally did this to somehow gain from the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "107    My identity was stolen. I filed a complaint, police report, affidavit, etc. I contacted the original company, and the collection agency to resolve this debt.

       "118    Select Portfolio Servicing has been deceptive and intimidating. It has been difficult for me to find my past due balance. I missed a regular monthly payment. When I attempted to make a payment to try to get caught up I could not find my past due balance. My printed statement listed a past due balance, but it did not list a payment that I had made prior to the statement being generated. My online account did not list a past due balance at all. It only told me that I had a regular monthly payment due. It also did not list any late fees or other fees of any kind. I then received a letter stating that my mortgage was now in default. This confused me even more because neither my statement or online account had any information about my loan being in default. Also, I did n't think my loan could be in default because I was approximately 30 days past due. I called SPS. When I called and entered in my account information, I was greeted by an audio recording stating that I had a regular monthly payment due. The recording made no reference to a past due balance or to my loan being in default or to any fees that may be due. I selected the option to speak with a representative. Prior to speaking with a representative I was greeted by another recording stating that I was about to speak with a \" debt collector '' and that any information given would be used in order to \" collect on a debt ''. At this point I felt SPS was deliberately trying to confuse and intimidate me. Is SPS a mortgage loan servicer or a debt collector? Is my account in default or past due? What is my past due balance? The rep I spoke with was polite, but not helpful. I did finally get my current past due balance. However, I was threatened with \" legal action '' if my account was not made current with in 6 days. I was not given an answer to why my online account does not reflect my past due balance, is my loan in default or past due, why do I have to pay {$15.00} to make an online payment, why did my interest rate go up. Furthermore, I was given unclear answers about what kind of a company SPS is ( mortgage loan servicer or debt collector ), why do they use intimidating language both in documents and over the phone, is SPS purposefully trying to confuse me. I acknowledge that I am past due on my payments, but it should not be this difficult to find my past due balance and I should not be threatened and intimidated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "124    I have documentation that shows that US Bank would not charge a Returned Item Fee nor an Overdraft Fee on my account ( Number XXXX ). When a withdrawal or other debit came in and there were non-sufficient funds, the payment was returned, without charging any fees, unless the resulting overdraft amount was negligible ( This occurred seven times between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX on the old account as shown by notices received in the mail attached herein ). \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a new account at US Bank ( XXXX XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, an overdraft fee was charged, and a few days later two other payments were returned, one other was returned and more fees were added. The Bank has failed to provide satisfactorily explanation of this change in policy. At the time of opening the new account, I was not given any notice or warning that new rules would apply. The Bank keeps adding extended overdraft fees. \\nIn my perception, the bank should have not honored any payments that were underfunded nor charged any fees for overdraft nor returned items because US Bank created a reasonable expectation through consistent behavior upon which reliance was reasonable. The Bank should bring the account to XXXX balance at its own expense. Further, the bank should refrain form a threatened charge off or any other report that will harm my credit history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "136    After 2 years of service with no issues Coinbase closed my account for no reason and furthermore refused to give me a reason despite dozens of request through their support channels.

       "152    I was dropped from my income based repayment plan by FedLoan servicing in XXXX of 2016. they contacted me by email but never tried to call me, even after being delinquent for over 2 months, ( while they had my current phone number on file ). When I checked my loans myself, I found statements saying I needed to pay over XXXX dollars of standard repayments that had accrued in order to remove the delinquency ( i believe this is predatory and illegal ). Instead I contacted an Ombudsman from the XXXX. She instructed me to declare forbearance ( which Fedloan services did not tell me was an option. FedLoan services told me I had to pay the full 2 months payments on a standard repayment plan I was now on, and continue to pay that amount until a new IBR payment plan was processed. this sounded fraudulent so I contacted a XXXX ombudsman. \\n\\nAfter the Ombudsman talked with the student loan company, both parties ( lender and ombudsman ) told me on XXXX XXXX that I would be entered into forbearance and a new loan document asking me to pay a nominal {$5.00} fee would be sent to me. After this fee is payed, I was told I would enter my repayment plan. I was assured my application was in their system and being processed, and Fedloan services person even confirmed they had my income verification documents showing I made around {$16000.00}, and would pay XXXX on an IBR plan. All I had to do was pay a {$5.00} fee to place the loan back on the payment plan. They said I should allow 3 weeks for them to \" process '' my plan, even though they literally had every piece of information in front of them. \\n\\nOn XXXX XXXX I received a letter informing me they were missing documentation of my income, which makes no sense, because the woman over the phone was able to tell me my income 4 days earlier. when I called Fedloan services they tell me I need to fill out a paper application for the IBR plan, and submit paper copies of my income verification which directly contradicts everything they told the ombudsman, and everything it says on both their website and XXXX. why do they even have an app with income verification tools if you need to send a paper application as well? \\n\\nI believe this company removed me from my plan in the first place in order to threaten me with fraudulent back payments. since early XXXX I have been trying to have my IBR plan processed, which is supposed to take less than 2 weeks and it is taking over 2 months. I have had to reapply for the IBR XXXX separate times now in 2 months, and have gone onto forbearence twice and Fedloan services has instructed me at every turn to fill out another form or send something in, or wait 3 weeks for somethings to be processed. \\n\\nThis entire time I have been living on an income of less than {$900.00} per month, working part time, and I can prove all of this. So I am well below the threshold for an IBR plan, and they even told me over the phone that I was eligible for {$0.00} payments. there is no excuse for them to be dragging their feet except to force me out of the IBR plan and into a plan where they can collect more money for not processing my information. \\n\\nI am still actively trying to pursue this matter with the ombudsman and Fedloan services, but I want to enter a formal complaint with the CFPB, as the behavior of my loan servicer has been dishonest and ( purposely! ) confusing, slow and incompetent to throw people like me into default so they can make more money off of fees.\n",
       "153    This complaint is regarding Wells Fargo. XX/XX/XXXX I refinanced my home mortgage taking cash out to make home repairs, pay off an auto loan and pay off an installment loan with Wells Fargo. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I made the final payment on the installment loan at a local Wells Fargo branch. This check included a slight overpayment. The payment on the loan, final accrued interest and overpayment were all processed on XXXX/XXXX/16. On XXXX/XXXX/16 Wells Fargo reversed the entire amount paid on XXXX/XXXX/16 telling me the loan payoff was coded incorrectly. The representative on the phone told me on XXXX/XXXX/16 the loan payment was being reprocessed and should be back dated to the actual payment date. In the meantime, Wells Fargo is telling me the same installment loan is past due and put a {$39.00} late charge on the account. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I called customer service to find out why the reprocessing of the loan payoff still had not gone through. I was told it was still in process. On Saturday, XXXX/XXXX/16 I went to the local branch where the original payment was made back on XXXX/XXXX/16. The personal banker called on this same installment loan and was told the payment was not made correctly. And that Wells Fargo is reprocessing the payment. This personal banker in the branch said everything was applied correctly on her end, so she felt this should be resolved and soon. Today, XXXX/XXXX/16 I contacted Wells Fargo customer service via phone again and was informed the bank check from the title company was returned for insufficient funds twice. We contacted the title company who confirmed verbally the check for the loan cleared their bank on XXXX/XXXX/16. Account numbers and check numbers were confirmed. Payments were due on this installment loan on the XXXX of each month. The loan is now XXXX days past due according to Wells Fargo. Yet I have a receipt with a transaction number proving I paid the loan IN FULL on XXXX/XXXX/16. This loan pay off was rolled into my current mortgage with Wells Fargo. So I feel they are trying to collect on the same debt twice and/or lost {$6800.00}! I keep getting told by Wells Fargo \" we need to research this '' but no one can seem to get this resolved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

It was my understanding that I only needed additional money to complete additional XXXX services, therefore, I was advised to sign up for Care Credit. I really did n't understand the way it was explained to me and the office manager called my mother over the phone to co-sign. The way it was explained was too complicated and not easily understood by me or my mother. I thought that the Care Credit would only be used for future XXXX services, but come to find out that not only was all of my health insurance benefits used, but also the full balance of the Care Credit card. Now, my mother and I have a judgment on our credit for the full balance of the Care Credit card, because I could not afford the payments and I was sued. I did n't understand how much the payments would be, nor the total amount that would be used. The office manager never gave me a copy of the documents either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
